**Interactive Story Customizer**
**Project Overview**
The Interactive Story Customizer is a Python tool that lets users create unique, personalized stories by filling in placeholders within a predefined story template. It's designed for educational, entertainment, and creative uses, allowing users to interactively generate customized narratives simply by providing specific words for each placeholder.

**Features**
Automatic Placeholder Detection: Automatically identifies placeholders in the story template, simplifying the process of customization.
User-Friendly Prompts: Requests user input for each placeholder to ensure an intuitive and easy customization process.
Dynamic Story Generation: Seamlessly inserts user responses into the story template to create a final, unique narrative.
Unlimited Story Variations: Every run can produce a completely different story based on user inputs, making it ideal for repeated use.

**Usage**
Prepare a story template in a plain text file, such as story.txt. In this template, enclose placeholders in angular brackets, like <noun>, <verb>, or <adjective>.
Run the script, and it will:
Read the story template.
Detect each placeholder within the story.
Prompt the user to provide words for each placeholder.
Replace the placeholders with the userâ€™s responses and display the completed story.
The final story is output directly to the terminal or console.

**How It Works**
File Reading: Reads the story template from a text file, allowing users to easily modify or create new templates.
Placeholder Detection: Searches the template for words enclosed within angular brackets (e.g., <adjective>, <noun>), marking each as a placeholder.
User Prompts: Asks users to enter words that will replace each detected placeholder, capturing responses in a structured format.
Story Generation: Replaces each placeholder in the template with the corresponding user-provided words, generating a final story that incorporates all inputs.

**Requirements**
This project requires Python 3.x to run, with no additional libraries needed.

**Running the Project**
Save your story template in a text file (e.g., story.txt).
Run the Python script, and follow the prompts as they appear on the screen to create your customized story.

**Customization**
Story Variations: Easily change the story by modifying story.txt to include different templates with unique placeholders.
Advanced Features: The script can be expanded to include additional capabilities, such as:
Saving completed stories to a new file.
Allowing for multiple story templates to choose from at runtime.
